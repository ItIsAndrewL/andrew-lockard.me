# andrew-lockard.me Portfolio Website

This project will be developed in Angular and hosted by Vercel. The main goal is to host and show all projects that Andrew Lockard has completed in a nice fashion. A secondary goal is to learn and become familiar with the following technologies/practices: 
- Devcontainers
- Hosting
- Domain names
- Starting an Angular project from scratch
- Creating Design and Specification Documentation

## Contributions

I will not be accepting any outside contributions since I want this project to reflect my own work.
