# andrew-lockard.me Portfolio Website Design Doc

> Author: Andrew Lockard

## 1. Overview

The key purpose for this portfolio website is to house all of Andrew
Lockard's projects, both class and personal, to be displayed for
potential career paths and others interested. In addition to this, the
website will also allow users to contact Andrew if they are interested
in following up with him. 
Finally, the website will house resume related details such as: 
previous positions, education, extra curricular activities, skills, 
and personal statements.

## 2. Key Personas

### Richard Recruiter

Recruiters are the main persona that this website is being developed for.
They will be using this website to gain more insight into Andrew's previous
work and skills. Recruiters are not expected to know anything about this
website upon navigating, and should be able to easily find the information
they are looking for. While a recruiter's main goal is to find information
on the candidate, the importance of a nicely designed website does not go
unnoticed.

### Cathy Classmate

Classmates may be directed to this website by Andrew or other students.
While they are not the primary persona expected to view this website, their
expectations should still be considered. Classmates are less likely to care
about the information on the page, and are more interested with the layout.
This being said, classmates should expect to see a nicely laid out website
with cool features to keep their interest peaked.

### Andrew Authentic

Andrew may occasionally reference this website to gather information for a
new job or club application and will expect information to be easily
accessible. Andrew will also periodically be updating the website with new
information and expects the process to be painless and simple.
